## Objective:
Create a DJ system with OSC Controller and PureData language.

## Explanation of the problem:
The project involves developing a DJ system that utilizes most of the app's widgets, such as sliders and buttons, ensuring that each interaction triggers an auditory response in PureData. This will enable the creation of electronic music pieces in a DJ style. A demo will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube, showcasing the system's capabilities with a DJ-style track that does not exceed 5 minutes in length.

## Proposed Solution:
In the development of this project, a total of 22 buttons, 24 toggles, and 4 sliders were integrated, carefully distributed across 4 different pages to optimize functionality. The first page focuses on the sliders, allowing precise control of the main parameters, while the following pages group the toggles and buttons, dedicated to more specific functions. Additionally, the sounds of a drum kit, a piano, and a guitar were carefully simulated, providing a wide range of sound textures. All available waveforms in PureData were also implemented, including sinusoidal, triangular, and square waves, among others, adding extra versatility for music creation within the system.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, we have done a good job addressing the requirements needed to create the music effectively. We relied on YouTube videos to manage the PureData application with the OSC Controller correctly, ensuring the successful development of the project.
